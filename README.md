To predict if an instagram user will follow you back if you follow him/her.
# Project Description:
To predict if an instagram user will follow you back if you follow him/her.
#Approach:
We have tried to use Classification Method but during scraping data we found out that for every 200 follows only 9 users follow us back. So, the instagram account of the user who is doing the analysis matters. Suppose, someone with high no of followers, let's say, quite famous follow a user, then the user has high probability to follow him back. So we tried to follow Cluster Method. Users same cluster will follow you back. So , what you need to do is get the account info and then check if you and that user is in the same cluster, if it is then he follows you back. This is an idea of our apporach. Further work on this project will certainly make it useful.
